Note about using quotes inside of inserted values
Hey everyone!
If you're wondering how to insert a string (VARCHAR) value that contains quotations, then here's how.

You can do it a couple of ways:

Escape the quotes with a backslash: "This text has \"quotes\" in it" or 'This text has \'quotes\' in it'

Alternate single and double quotes: "This text has 'quotes' in it" or 'This text has "quotes" in it'
