GoormIDE Registration IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ!!!
Hello Everyone! 
Cloud9 was acquired by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and they closed down the legacy version of Cloud9 (c9.io), that I use in the lectures.

While you can sign up for the new AWS version of Cloud9, that is not something that we recommend as it requires a credit card to use the free trial and is not exactly beginner friendly.

Instead, we now recommend using a different cloud based IDE called, GoormIDE.
Goorm is a great IDE and is fairly similar to the legacy version of Cloud9 that I use in the video lectures.

Everything that I mentioned in the previous video, regarding the use of Cloud9, can also be applied to Goorm.

Our TA (Ian) has created a readme file that explains the signup and setup processes for Goorm.

Please go >>> https://gist.github.com/nax3t/2773378c4d1bada8d66d12f4d5210248 <<< to view signup and setup instructions.
Once you finish with the instructions, then you can continue with the next section in the course.
